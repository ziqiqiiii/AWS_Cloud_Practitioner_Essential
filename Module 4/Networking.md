### AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources.
Amazon VPC enables users to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud.
In this isolated section, users can launch resources in a virtual network that users define. 
Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), users can organize their resources into subnets. (A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.)

### Virtual Private Gateway

A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.
