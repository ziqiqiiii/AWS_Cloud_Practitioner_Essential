### Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch(opens in a new tab) is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.

- CloudWatch uses metrics(opens in a new tab) to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time. 
- With CloudWatch, you can create alarms(opens in a new tab) that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold. 

#### CloudWatch Dashboard 
The CloudWatch dashboard(opens in a new tab) feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location.
